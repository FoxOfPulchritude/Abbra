			<h1>College Affordability</h1>
			<p>With tuition rates at an all time high and the government more than $1.2 trillion in debt from student loans, many presidential candidates have made college affordability a major talking point.  We took plans from both sides of the political spectrum to help you find the plan that best suits you. </p>

			<h1>"The New College Compact"</h1>
			<p>Unfortunately, Clinton has not provided any numbers that we can use to calculate an exact number people could be saving on college with her plan.  What we do know is that community college will be free, and tuition at four-year universities will be reduced through a combination of cost control at universities, as well as federal and state aid.  We also know that the savings students receive will be based on family income and interest rates on student loan programs will be lowered as well.</p>
			<p>Clinton has estimated that her plan would cost roughly $350 billion over 10 years.  Clinton hopes to pay for her plan by decreasing tax deductions for higher-income Americans.  Her plan also requires a certain level of investment by states in their respective university budgets.</p>
