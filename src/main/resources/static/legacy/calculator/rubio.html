			<h1>His Plan</h1>
			<p>Rubio wants rich individuals and hedge funds to invest in students&#39; college tuitions.  Investors would pay a student&#39;s entire tuition and then the student would give the investor a small percentage of their annual income for a set period of time.  The example Rubio provided was an investor paying a $10,000 tuition and the student giving the investor four percent of their annual income after college for ten years.  Chris Christie also supports this plan.</p>

			<h1>Noteworthy Info</h1>
			<p>Rubio is also a supporter of the &quot;Student RIght to Know Before You Go&quot; act.  This act says that a university must provide information to potential students that could affect their choice to go to that school.  The necessary information includes: post-graduation average annual income. Rates of remedial enrollment, credit accumulation, and graduation. Average cost of the program and average debt accumulated.</p>
